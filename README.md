This Google Chrome extension is a faster way to find images and image-url's. Instead of opening up Google Images and copying the image-url to your clipboard, just search for an image and click the button to copy the link.<br>I use it while looking for images and image-url's to include in HTML pages for projects or just to look up photos of things I come across that I can't quite picture in my head (such as animals, coutry flags, etc.)<br>
Instructions<br>
Clone this repo, go to chrome://extensions in the chrome, click "Load unpacked extension.." and find/select this project. The icon (currently no icon so it will show up as a puzzle piece) should pop up in the extensions section. Ready to go!!
