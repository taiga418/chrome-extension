This Google Chrome extension is a faster way to find images and image-urls. Instead of opening up Google Images and copying the image-url to your clipboard, just search for an image and click the button to copy the link.<br>I use it while looking for images and image-urls to include in HTML pages for projects or just to look up photos of things I come across that I can't quite picture in my head (animals, coutry flags, etc.)<br>
<b><u>Instructions</u></b><br>
Clone this repo, go to chrome://extensions in Chrome, click "Load unpacked extension.." and find/select this project. The icon (currently no icon so it will show up as a puzzle piece) should pop up in the extensions section. Ready to go!!<br>
<b><u>ToDo</u></b><br>
Add to UI(looks a little plain...)<br>
Filter broken image links<br>
Publish to Chrome Store<br>
